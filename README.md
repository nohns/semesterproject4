# Semester project 3 - Foo Bar ðŸ“ˆðŸ“‰
This repository represents the 4th semester project for software engineering students at Aarhus University.
Project requirements are usage of the acquired skills we have learned during the semester.
The project is a web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete data.

How to run the application:
-Navigate to backend/cmd and type "go run main.go" in your terminal
-Navigate to frontend and type "npm install" followed by "npm run dev"
-Navigate to BeveragePaymentApi and type "docker compose -f "docker-compose.yaml" up -d --build"
    (Remember to have Docker open :))
